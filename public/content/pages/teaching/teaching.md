  <p>Each person comes to music with different expectations and goals. As a
  teacher who has worked with early beginners as well as adult students, I try
  to understand where the student is coming from and help them discover where
  they want to project themselves. I believe that sharing my genuine passion for
  music and my love for the violin is the best starting point.  I think of
  teaching as a discovery journey. The teacher's role should be of assistance in
  discovering the traditions of the great violinists as well as encouraging
  students to find their own voice and expression. I commit to help my students
  to explore a wide variety of violin playing traditions (violin schools and
  techniques) and styles (composers and genres). In addition to this, I
  encourage them to develop their own musical personality and to be aware of
  their bodies as they engage in sound production.</p> <p>I incorporate body
  mapping concepts such as naturalness as a guiding principle (finding what is
  comfortable and efficient), interdependence of all elements involved in violin
  playing (proportions and balance), and the relationship of mind to muscles
  (mental control over physical movement).</p><p>In my training, I have
  discovered that understanding the language of music from an analitical point
  of view has helped me to better express myself. I encourage musical analysis
  to improve expression, coherence, and memorization.</p> <p>I strongly believe
  that music should ultimately connect the community functioning as a social
  unifier while celebrating diversity. In my studio I intend to create a
  comfortable atmosphere for everyone to share who they are and play music
  together.</p>
